# Exame Epoca Recurso 2019

## Exercise 1

### 1.1

State: The current position in the form `[x, y]`

Initial State: 
```
[1, 2]
```

Objective:
```
[3, 4]
```

Operators:

- U: Move up (-1 in y coodinate)
- R: Move right (+1 in x coodinate)
- D: Move down (+1 in y coodinate)
- L: Move left (-1 in x coodinate)

Cost Function: Number of moves to go from origin position to the objective position.

### 1.4

This algorithm represents the Breath-First Search algorithm because it visits a node and puts its children in the end of the list. This way, the slgorithm will visit every child of a node before visiting the child of another node, which means this is the BFS. In order to make it an Iterative-Deepening Depth-First algorithm we need to make it like the following pseudo-code:

## Exercise 3

### 3.1

```
Depth 1: 1
Depth 2: 1 2
Depth 3: 1 2 3
Depth 4: 1 2 3 1 4
```


### 3.2

The best heuristics to use would be `C`. As the heuristics are admissible, they never overestimate the actual cost which means that their values will never be higher than the cost itself. When using heuristics, the closer the estimative is to the real cost, the better the heuristics is. With that in mind, if we have two heuristics, the best way to use them would be to get the maximum value between those two, as it will always be equal or less than the actual cost but will be the closer value.
