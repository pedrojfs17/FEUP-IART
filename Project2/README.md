# Ball Sort Puzzle

## Requirements

- [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/)
- [gym](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/gym)
- [matplotlib](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/matplotlib)
- [numpy](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/numpy)
- [seaborn](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/seaborn)

## Building and Running

For a simplified installation and execution of the program:

Run Anaconda and create a new Environment with Python 3.8.
Install both the **CMD.exe Prompt** and **Notebook**.
In the CMD console, run the following commands:

- `conda install -c conda-forge gym`
- `conda install -c conda-forge matplotlib`
- `conda install -c anaconda numpy`
- `conda install -c anaconda seaborn`

In the Notebook, open [ballsort.ipynb](ballsort.ipynb) and run the notebook to see the results.
To see the implementation of the environment go to [environment.py](environment.py) and [tube.py](tube.py).
